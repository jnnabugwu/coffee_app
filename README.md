# coffee_app
 A coffee app that lets users save their favorite coffee 

As a user, I should be able to:
● Open the app and load a new coffee image from the network
● Load a new coffee image if the current one is not my favorite
● Save the current coffee image locally if I really like it, so I can access my
favorite coffee images at any time, even if I don’t have internet access
○ Make sure any loading/error states are handled correctly
